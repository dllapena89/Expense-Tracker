# Expense-Tracker
Kotlin Project

# Overview

This project is to show an understanding of a new language. My hope is to broaden my horizon toward coding and the different effects of different languages. 
I also intend to find what program language I want to excel in. 

This program is a basic application of an expense tracker. I am trying to make this into an Android app. 
The application provides inputting: how much when was the expense, and a description of the expenses.
Additional future was also added such as viewing entered expenses and deleting as well.
